# Linear_Regression-R
The objective of this study is to determine whether a human body circumference measurement could be used as a general indicator for human body fat percentage. Such body circumference measurement could then be used to predict the body fat percentage by establishing a simple linear formula. The study will further assess how well this linear formula performs to estimate the body fat percentage by comparing the predicted values against the real values. All the statistical computations have been performed in the ‘R Studio’ package in this study.

A data-set of 252 people (160 male and 92 female) with their body fat percentages (Brozek method) and ten different body circumference measurements have been used in this study. The Source for the data-set: Roger W. Johnson. March 1996. Fitting Percentage of Body Fat to Simple Body Measurements. Journal of Statistics Education, Volume 4, Number 1.
